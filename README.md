# airboard

Airboard is a Progressive Web Application which allows the users to easily setup ad hoc chat and voting functionality in the context of a competitive event such as a football/soccer match, a food truck festival or a hackathon. Front end will be in React or Solid.JS deployed as PWA. Backend will be in Java/TBD.

The initial application will be developed during [Oklathon 2024](https://techlahoma.github.io/oklathon/). 

We will follow a pragamtic approach and get MVP out as soon as possible.
